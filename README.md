# CS50 Solutions Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to problem sets (psets) from Harvard's CS50 courses.

So far, I have completed:

* **CS50X – Introduction to Computer Science**
* **CS50P – Introduction to Programming with Python**

I may later add solutions from:

* CS50SQL
* CS50R
* CS50AI

## Repository Structure

The project follows a structured and consistent hierarchy:

```
cs50/
│
├── cs50x/
│   ├── pset0/
│   ├── pset1/
│   ├── pset2/
│   └── ...
│
├── cs50p/
│   ├── pset0/
│   ├── pset1/
│   │   ├── bank/
│   │   │   └── bank.py
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
│
└── (future courses)
```

Each problem set contains its own subdirectory, and each exercise within a pset has its own folder.
