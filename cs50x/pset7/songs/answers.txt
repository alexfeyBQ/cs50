Let's suppose that Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at
the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s
top 100 songs from the past year.

SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, I would characterize their audio aura as
moderately energetic, neutral in mood, and fairly danceable. This suggests that the listener tends to favor
songs that are upbeat and suitable for movement, but with a relatively balanced emotional tone.

However, this calculation might not be fully representative of the listener.
Using a simple average ignores the fact that some songs may have been played far more frequently than others,
which could skew the perception of the listener’s preferences. It also does not account for changes in taste over time,
or for context such as listening during different times of day or for different activities.

A better way to calculate the audio aura could be to weight the songs by their number of plays,
to consider temporal patterns in listening habits, and to include additional musical features such as tempo, key, or acousticness.
This would create a more nuanced and accurate representation of the listener’s musical personality.
