HTML Tags I used:
<h1> - Title
<h2> - Sections subtitles
<h6> - Sub-subtitles such as "Dream school"
<p> - Make paragraph for readability and style
<a> - Link for my other page, and social media
<div> - Container for my sections, headers
<ul> - Create the list of my goals and dream schools
<li> - Elements inside <ul>
<img> - Logos and illustrations
<button> - "Cheers!" button and informations
<strong> - Highlight important terms

CSS Selectors I used:
.header
.header .nav-link
.header .nav-link:hover
.section
.logo
.illustration
.cheer

CSS Properties I used:
background-color – For headers and buttons colors
color – Text colors
border / border-radius – Remove default borders and make buttons rounded
padding – Spacing inside headers, buttons, and sections
margin – Spacing around sections, images, and logos
width / height – Resize images and illustrations
display – Layout control for images and logos
text-align – Center text in header
font-weight – Boldness for navigation links
text-decoration – Remove underline from links

I used bootstrap for layout, collapsing components (info cards) and the buttons as well.
I also made a JavaScript script in "hobbies.html" to make a "Cheers!" button that displays
a simple message.

PS: I'm sorry if I eventually forget to mention something :(
