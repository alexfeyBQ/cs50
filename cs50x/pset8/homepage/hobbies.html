                    My hobbies are diverse. Despite my strong STEM background, I also enjoy Humanities subjects, particularly History, Social Sciences and Philosophy.
                    I like many things including reading, sports and arts. I'm taking piano lessons at the local conservatory and I go to the gym to
                    get some exercise and stay healthy.

                <p>
                    I have a passion for aeronautics, I took courses to learn the basics of aeronautics,
                    navigation, meteorology, etc., in 10th grade. I'm also very engaged in the climate cause.

                    One of my favorite activities, besides learning and staying active, is exploring my region.
                    I enjoy spending time with friends in Paris. My favorite places include museums, such as the Museum of Modern Arts, the Louvre, and the Pompidou Center.
                    I love the cozy atmosphere and the quietness, which allow me to absorb as much of the abstract beauty of the arts as I can.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm also interested in finance. I'm currently trying to learn how to manage my portfolio and understand market concepts.
