                    I'm a 16-year-old senior high school student from France, living in the Greater Paris Metropolitan Region.
                    I don't come from a computer science background, as I'm currently studying Mathematics, Advanced Mathematics,
                    Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering Sciences at my high school. In France, students can choose only
                    3 “specialties” in 11th grade and 2 in 12th grade. I chose Mathematics, Physics-Chemistry (combined into a single specialty), and Engineering Sciences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>CS courses</strong> were offered as a specialty, but I couldn't take them because that would have meant taking 4 specialties at once.
                    I ended up keeping Mathematics and Physics-Chemistry for my senior year and had to drop Engineering Sciences.
                    I'm currently taking <strong>CS50x</strong> to learn the basics of computer science. I plan to take further courses afterward, as I am interested in modeling.
                    I'm far from being fully comfortable with all the concepts covered in CS50x, but I push myself every day to learn more!
